  "description": "Version 81 separates the person counting and PPE detection logic into two independent modules.  The basic **PersonTracker** detects and tracks people and logs entry/exit events to `person_logs`, pushing PPE-check items to `ppe_queue`.  A new **PPEDetector** reads those queue entries and stores the results in `ppe_logs`. Older entries are pruned automatically based on the configurable `ppe_log_retention_secs` window. Camera configuration now uses grouped tasks for counting and PPE detection.",
